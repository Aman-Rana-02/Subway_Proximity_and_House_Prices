  \begin{abstract}
    \noindent \citet{zhou_2019} shows us that the completion of subway lines increases the prices of real estate in their vicinity. Our contribution will be to look at these effects in London. 
     We find precise null effects by a multivariate linear regression of the log of house prices on distance to the nearest station in metres, with controls for time and district.
    We find a slope coefficient of -0.0001261 with a standard error of 0.00000145 on the subway distance variable. 
     The effect is economically insignificant, even a 10km distance from a station (which is above the 95th 
     On more relative terms, a standard deviation difference in distance is only associated with a 
     percentile of our distance data) would lead to only a 0.2\% decrease in house price. This statistically significant relationship of small effect leads us to conclude precise null effects.
     14\% of a standard deviation change in log house price. While the marginal effect of distance is precisely null, we find a threshold effect:
      the price of houses within 2km of a subway station is 0.18\% higher than those further away, with economic and statistical significance after controlling for district and time fixed effects.
